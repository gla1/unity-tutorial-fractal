enjoyed the heck out of this one, makes some really whacky shapes! i also followed the suggestion to include randomized scale which led to some interesting realizations about how scale works (aka don't use a scale range of 5, -5 unless you want to see nothing or a single gigantic object)

biggest frustration was the lack of an opinionated formatter like gofmt to sort my class's attributes because I added them over time without sufficient concern for how it would impact the configuration panel in Unity :/

similarly, the amount of "chrome" in c# compared to golang is very noticeable. of particular note is the need to add semicolons all over the place which, to my eyes, is second only to the crime of python's whitespace formatting in how little milk we get for all this moo.
