# unity-tutorial-fractal
from: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/constructing-a-fractal/

enjoyed the heck out of this one, makes some really whacky shapes! i also followed the suggestion to include randomized scale which led to some interesting realizations about how scale works (aka don't use a scale range of 5, -5 unless you want to see nothing or a single gigantic object)

biggest frustration was the lack of an opinionated formatter like gofmt to sort my class's attributes because I added them over time without sufficient concern for how it would impact the configuration panel in Unity :/
